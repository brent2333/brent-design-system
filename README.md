# Brent Design

This project is a React/Storybook Design System

As a project for demonstrating my grasp of the major concepts in the creation of Design Systems, and establishing the ideal toolset for creating one, I bring you the Brent Lawson Design System.

This is, of course, a living document of the process, as all of these systems should be. This is not intended to serve as a blueprint for the creation of any specific web application, but merely a vehicle for exploration and demonstration.

Thanks for checking it out!
